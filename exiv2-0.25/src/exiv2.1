.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
.B exiv2
is a program to read and write Exif, IPTC, XMP metadata and
image comments and can read many vendor makernote tags. The program 
optionally converts between Exif tags, XMP properties and IPTC
datasets as recommended by the Exif Standard, the IPTC Standard,
the XMP specification and Metadata Working Group guidelines.
.br
The following image formats are supported:

.IP \(bu 2
Support for GIF, TGA and BMP images is minimal: the image format is
recognized, a MIME type assigned to it and the height and width of the
image are determined.
.IP \(bu 2
Reading other TIFF-like RAW image formats, which are not listed in the
table, may also work.
.SH ACTIONS
The \fIaction\fP argument is only required if it is not clear from the
\fIoptions\fP which action is implied.
.TP
.B pr | print
Print image metadata. This is the default action, i.e., the command
\fIexiv2 image.jpg\fP will print a summary of the image Exif metadata.
.TP
.B ex | extract
Extract metadata to *.exv, XMP sidecar (*.xmp) and thumbnail image files.
Modification commands can be applied on-the-fly.
.TP
.B in | insert
Insert metadata from corresponding *.exv, XMP sidecar (*.xmp) and
thumbnail files.  Use option \fB\-S\fP \fI.suf\fP to change the suffix
of the input files. Since files of any supported format can be used as
input files, this command can be used to copy the metadata between
files of different formats. Modification commands can be applied
on-the-fly.
.TP
.B rm | delete
Delete image metadata from the files.
.TP
.B ad | adjust
Adjust Exif timestamps by the given time. Requires at least one of the
options \fB\-a\fP \fItime\fP, \fB\-Y\fP \fIyrs\fP, \fB\-O\fP
\fImon\fP or \fB\-D\fP \fIday\fP.
.TP
.B mo | modify
Apply commands to modify (add, set, delete) the Exif, IPTC and XMP
metadata of image files. Requires option \fB\-c\fP, \fB\-m\fP or
\fB\-M\fP.
.TP
.B mv | rename
Rename files and/or set file timestamps according to the Exif create
timestamp. Uses the value of tag Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal or, if
not present, Exif.Image.DateTime to determine the timestamp. The
filename format can be set with \fB\-r\fP \fIfmt\fP, timestamp options
are \fB\-t\fP and \fB\-T\fP.
.TP
.B fi | fixiso
Copy the ISO setting from one of the proprietary Nikon or Canon
makernote ISO tags to the regular Exif ISO tag,
Exif.Photo.ISOSpeedRatings. Does not overwrite an existing standard
Exif ISO tag.
.TP
.B fc | fixcom
Fix the character encoding of Exif Unicode user comments.  Decodes the
comment using the auto-detected or specified character encoding and
writes it back in UCS-2. Use option \fB\-n\fP to specify the current
encoding of the comment if necessary.

.nf
   exiv2 \-m cmd.txt image.jpg
.fi
.sp 1
or given on the command line, as in
.sp 1
.nf
   exiv2 \-M"add Iptc.Application2.Credit String Mr. Smith" image.jpg
.fi
.sp 1
Note the quotes. Multiple \fB\-m\fP and \fB\-M\fP options can be combined,
and a non-standard XMP namespace registered.
.sp 1
.nf
   exiv2 \-M"reg myprefix http://ns.myprefix.me/" \-M"add Xmp.myprefix.Whom Mr. Smith" \-M"set Exif.Image.Artist Mr. Smith" image.jpg
.fi
.sp 1
When writing Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata,
.B exiv2
enforces only a correct
metadata structure. It is possible to write tags with types and values
different from those specified in the standards, duplicate Exif tags,
undefined tags, or incomplete metadata. While
.B exiv2
is able to read
all metadata that it can write, other programs may have difficulties
with images that contain non standard-conforming metadata.
.SS Command format
The format of a command is
.sp 1
.nf
\fBset | add | del\fP \fIkey\fP [[\fItype\fP] \fIvalue\fP]
.fi
.TP
.B set
Set the \fIvalue\fP of an existing tag with a matching \fIkey\fP or
add the tag.
.TP
.B add
Add a tag (unless \fIkey\fP is a non\-repeatable IPTC key; nothing
prevents you from adding duplicate Exif tags).
.TP
.B del
Delete all occurrences of a tag (requires only a \fIkey\fP).
.TP
.I key
Exiv2 Exif, IPTC or XMP key.
.TP
.I type
.B Byte | Ascii | Short | Long | Rational | Undefined | SShort | SLong | SRational | Comment
for Exif keys,
.br
.B String | Date | Time | Short | Undefined
for IPTC keys, and
.br
.B XmpText | XmpAlt | XmpBag | XmpSeq | LangAlt
for XMP keys.
.sp 1
A default \fItype\fP is used if none is explicitly given. The default
is determined based on \fIkey\fP.
.TP
.I value
The remaining text on the line is the value. It can optionally be
enclosed in single quotes ('\fIvalue\fP') or double quotes ("\fIvalue\fP").
.sp 1
The value is optional. Not providing any value is equivalent to an
empty value ("") and is mainly useful to create an XMP array property,
e.g., a bag.
.sp 1
The format of Exif \fBComment\fP values includes an optional charset
specification at the beginning:
.br
.B   [charset=Ascii|Jis|Unicode|Undefined ]\fIcomment\fP
.sp 1
.B Undefined
is used by default if the value doesn't start with a charset
definition.
.sp 1
The format for an IPTC \fBDate\fP value is:
.br
    YYYY\-MM\-DD (year, month, day)
.sp 1
The format for an IPTC \fBTime\fP value is:
.br
    HH:MM:SS (hours, minutes, seconds)
.br
and may optionally be followed by:
.br
   \-HH:MM or +HH:MM (hours, minutes ahead/behind UTC)
.sp 1
The format of \fBRational\fP (and \fBSRational\fP) is one of:
.br
    integer
.br
    integer-numerator/integer-denominator
.br
    Fnumber
.br
    fnumber
.sp 1
Rational Examples:
.br
    exiv2 "-Mset Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue 557429/62500" X.jpg
.br
    exiv2 "-Mset Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue F5.6" X.jpg
.sp 1
The Rational format Fnumber (or fnumber) is for the convenience of setting aperture values.  Aperture values
are stored in Exif is an \fBAPEX\fP value which can be evaluated by the expression:
.sp 1
    apex-value  =    log(Fnumber) * 2.0 / log(2.0)
.br
    Fnumber     = exp(apex-value * log(2.0) / 2.0)
.sp 1
The Rational format Fnumber is valid for any \fBRational\fP, even when the key is not an Aperture.
More information about \fBAPEX\fP value is available from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEX_system
.sp 1
The format of XMP \fBLangAlt\fP values includes an optional language qualifier:
.br
.B  lang="\fIlanguage-code\fP\fI" text\fP
.sp
lang="x-default" is used if the value doesn't start with a language qualifier.
.sp 1
    exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="de-DE" Euros' X.jpg
.br
    exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-GB" Pounds' X.jpg
.br
    exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-US" In God We Trust' X.jpg
.br
    exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title All others pay cash' X.jpg
.sp 1
To remove a language specification, set the value to '' (empty string)
.br
    exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-US"' X.jpg
.sp 1
To remove all language specifications, delete the key:
.br
    exiv2 -M'del Xmp.dc.title' X.jpg
.TP
To register additional XMP namespaces, combine the command with:
.TP
.nf
\fBreg\fP \fIprefix\fP \fInamespace\fP
.fi
.SS Command file format
Empty lines and lines starting with \fB#\fP in a command file are
ignored (comments). Remaining lines are commands as described above.
