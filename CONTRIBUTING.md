## Style

nomacs might have a weird coding style at the first glance, however we try to follow at least some rules:

- `using namespace` is prohibited (even for `std`)
- Naming
  - Class names start with a capital letter (i.e. `DkBaseManipulator`).
  - Methods start with lowercase (i.e. `name()`).
  - Prefix members with an m (i.e. `int mAction = 0`).
  - Prefix classes with `Dk`.
- Braces have to be set in the same line
- Encapsulate everything with the namespace `nmc`

Right:

```cpp
namespace nmc {

class DllCoreExport DkBaseManipulator {

public:
  DkBaseManipulator(QAction* action = 0);

  QString name() const;

private:
  QAction* mAction = 0;
};

}
```

Wrong:

```cpp
class DllCoreExport baseManipulator
{

public:
  baseManipulator(QAction* Action = 0);

  QString Name() const;

private:
  QAction* action = 0;
};
```
