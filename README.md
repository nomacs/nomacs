[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nomacs/nomacs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nomacs/nomacs)

## Build nomacs (Windows)
### Compile dependencies
- `Qt` SDK or the compiled sources (>= 5.2.1)
- `Exiv2` (>= 0.25)
- `OpenCV` (>= 2.4.6) _optional_
- `LibRaw` (>= 0.17) _optional_
- `Python` (>= 3.6) for build scripts

### Compile LibRaw
- only needed if ENABLE_RAW is checked
- checkout https://github.com/nomacs/LibRaw
- switch to 0.XX-stable branch
- follow the build instructions
- in the nomacs CMake, set `libraw_DIR` to that build path

### Compile nomacs
1. Open CMake GUI
2. set your ImageLounge folder to `where is the source code`
3. choose a build folder
4. Set `QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE` by locating the qmake.exe
5. Set `OpenCV_DIR` to your OpenCV build folder
6. Hit `Configure`then `Generate`
7. Open the `nomacs.sln` which is in your new build directory
8. Right-click the nomacs project and choose `Set as StartUp Project`
9. Compile the Solution

### If anything did not work
- check if you have setup opencv (otherwise uncheck ENABLE_OPENCV)
- check if your Qt is set correctly (otherwise set the path to `qt_install_dir/qtbase/bin/qmake.exe`)
- check if your builds proceeded correctly

## Build nomacs (Ubuntu)

Get the required packages:

``` console
sudo apt-get install debhelper cdbs qt5-qmake qttools5-dev-tools qt5-default qttools5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qt5-image-formats-plugins libexiv2-dev libraw-dev libopencv-dev cmake libtiff-dev libquazip-dev libwebp-dev git build-essential lcov libzip-dev
```
Get the nomacs sources from github:
``` console
git clone https://github.com/nomacs/nomacs.git
```
This will by default place the source into ~/nomacs

Go to the nomacs/ImageLounge directory and run `cmake` to get the Makefiles:
``` console
cmake .
```

Compile nomacs:
``` console
make
```

You will now have a binary (~/nomacs/nomacs), which you can test (or use directly). To install it to /usr/local/bin, use:
``` console
sudo make install
```
note that you have to execute
``` console
sudo ldconfig
```
on your own after a successfully install

## Build nomacs (OSX)
Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) for easier installation of depenedencies.

Install required dependencies:

```
$ brew install qt5 exiv2 opencv libraw quazip
```

Go to the `nomacs` directory and run cmake to get the Makefiles

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ Qt5_DIR=/usr/local/opt/qt5/ cmake -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/opt/qt5/bin ../ImageLounge/.
```

Run make:

```
$ make
```

You will now have a binary (`nomacs.app`), which you can test (or use directly). To install it to `/usr/local/bin`, use

```
$ sudo make install
```
