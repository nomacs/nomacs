## Get the Source

```console
git clone https://github.com/nomacs/nomacs.git
cd nomacs

# nomacs uses submodules for third party libraries
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Build nomacs (Windows)

We assume you have an IDE (i.e. Visual Studio), python, git, and [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source) installed.

Get all dependencies:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Project folders in ``3rd-party`` will not be empty anymore. Now call:

```bash
python scripts/make.py "qtpath/bin"
```

This will build nomacs into `build/nomacs`. If you are using Visual Studio, you can then double-click `build/nomacs/nomacs.sln`. Right-click the nomacs project and choose `Set as StartUp Project`.

Build individual projects using:

```bash
python scripts/make.py "qt/bin" --project quazip,libraw --force
```

### Developer Build

I like having a separate developer build (without submodules) that uses 3rd party libs already compiled. To do so you need to:

```bash
git submodule update --init --remote scripts 

# python scripts/make.py "C:\Qt\Qt-5.14.1-installer\5.14.2\msvc2017_64\bin" --lib-path C:\coding\nomacs\nomacs\3rd-party\build
python scripts/make.py "qt/bin" --lib-path "nomacs/3rd-party/build"
```

### If anything did not work

- check if you have setup opencv (otherwise uncheck ENABLE_OPENCV)
- check if your Qt is set correctly (otherwise set the path to `qt_install_dir/qtbase/bin/qmake.exe`)
- check if your builds proceeded correctly

## Build nomacs (Linux/Unix)

Before you build nomacs, please note the following:

- Nomacs requires using Qt6.
- [kimageformats-plugins]([https://github.com/KDE/kimageformats](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kimageformats)) is an optional dependency that provides additional formats such as AVIF, HEIC/HEIF, and JPEG XL/JXL. The Qt version of the plugins should match the Qt version when compiling nomacs.
- Zip file support requires Quazip, which has varied support in distributions. If the system package is missing or does not work, you can set `USE_SYSTEM_QUAZIP=NO` to use the version in nomacs/3rdparty. However, you may also need to remove the any system quazip development package temporarily. (such as `llibquazip*-dev` for Ubuntu)

### Get the required packages

The package lists and cmake configuration listed below enable all features in nomacs, which we recommend. However, if you do not want a particular feature you can omit certain packages.

#### Build options and their dependencies

This is the list of configurable packages and what they provide in nomacs. To ensure a feature is included/excluded set the cmake option for that feature. By default, all features are enabled if the dependencies are found when running cmake**.

The following Qt components are necessary: Core, Concurrent, Network, PrintSupport, SVG, Widgets, Core5Compat.

There are other optional features that can be enabled during build:

| Option             | Depends on     | Requires        | Description
| ------------------ | -------------- | --------------- | -
| `ENABLE_RAW`       | LibRAW         | `ENABLE_OPENCV` | Enables reading RAW images
| `ENABLE_TIFF`      | LibTiff        | `ENABLE_OPENCV` | Enable reading multi-page TIFF
| `ENABLE_QUAZIP`    | Quazip**       |                 | Enable reading from zip files
| `ENABLE_OPENCV`    | OpenCV         |                 | RAW, TIFF, Adjustments, High-quality thumbnails, DRIF files, histogram, mosaic
| `ENABLE_PLUGINS`   | nomacs/plugins | `ENABLE_OPENCV` | Paint on image, Composite, Affine Transform, Fake Miniatures, Page Extraction
| `ENABLE_TESTING`   | GoogleTest     |                 | Enables `make check` target for unit testing

(**) Quazip is not enabled by default as of nomacs 3.19.1

#### Runtime dependencies

Additional packages will be used by nomacs if they are available at runtime, and they use the same Qt version as nomacs (5 or 6).

- QImageFormats: Enables reading ICNS, MNG, TGA, TIFF, WBMP, WEBP
- KImageFormats: Enables reading AVIF, HEIF/HEIC, JXL, EXR, EPS and [more](https://github.com/KDE/kimageformats)

#### Ubuntu 24.04

```console
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev qt6-svg-dev qt6-image-formats-plugins libexiv2-dev libraw-dev libopencv-dev libtiff-dev libtiff-dev libquazip1-qt6-dev build-essential git cmake lcov libgtest-dev
```

#### Ubuntu 22.04

```console
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev qt6-tools-dev-tools libqt6svg6-dev libqt6core5compat6-dev qt6-l10n-tools qt6-image-formats-plugins libexiv2-dev libraw-dev libopencv-dev libtiff-dev libtiff-dev build-essential git cmake lcov libgtest-dev libgl-dev
```

#### Arch

```console
# qt6
sudo pacman -S qt6-base qt6-imageformats qt6-svg qt6-tools quazip-qt6 exiv2 libraw libtiff opencv kimageformats git cmake gtest base-devel
```

#### Redhat/Fedora/CentOS (tested on Rocky 9.5)

```console
sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtimageformats qt6-qtsvg-devel qt6-qttools-devel qt6-qt5compat-devel LibRaw-devel opencv-devel exiv2-devel libtiff-devel git cmake lcov gtest-devel gcc-c++
```

#### FreeBSD (14.2 release)

```console
sudo pkg install qt6-base qt6-imageformats qt6-svg qt6-5compat qt6-tools quazip-qt6 tiff exiv2 kf6-kimageformats libraw opencv git cmake googletest gcc
```

#### Haiku (r1 beta 5)

```console
# qt6
pkgman install qt6_base_devel qt6_tools_devel qt6_svg_devel qt6_5compat_devel quazip1_qt6_devel tiff_devel libraw_devel opencv_devel gtest_devel exiv2_devel kimageformats6 qt6_imageformats cake git gcc make pkgconfig lcms_devel
```

### Configure nomacs

Nomacs is configured with cmake. These cmake options are often needed:

- ENABLE_QUAZIP=[ON|OFF] - Default OFF
- USE_SYSTEM_QUAZIP=[ON|OFF] - Default ON
- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo] - For normal usage, choose `RelWithDebInfo`. For development, `Debug` builds have more logging as well as debug symbols.

```console
cd nomacs
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ImageLounge
```

### Compile nomacs

```console
make [-j 8]
```

You will now have a binary (~/nomacs/build/nomacs), which you can use directly, however you may need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for this to work. You can check the log output to see that nomacs is loading configuration files from the expected locations.

```console
# running nomacs from ~/nomacs/build/
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./nomacs
```

## Build and run tests

Nomacs uses [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest), which is included in the package lists above. A `check` target will be created if GoogleTest is present. To build and run tests:

```bash
make check
```

### Install nomacs

By default nomacs is installed to /usr/local/ unless you set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`

```console
sudo make install
# ldconfig is required on most linux distros
# Some systems you also require changes to 
# `/etc/ld.so.conf` to add `/usr/local/lib` 
sudo ldconfig
```

### For Package Maintainers

- Highly recommended optional dependency: nomacs officially supported [plugins](https://github.com/nomacs/nomacs-plugins/), provide core features like paint-on-image. Enabled by default if `nomacs/ImageLounge/plugins` submodule is present.
- Recommended optional dependency: qt-imageformats-plugins provides WEBP and many more formats
- Recommended optional dependency: quazip provides support for reading images from zip files (with `ENABLE_QUAZIP=ON`). In the unlikely case there is a conflict with the quazip package, you may use 3rdparty/quazip with `USE_SYSTEM_QUAZIP=OFF`.
- Recommended optional dependency: kimageformats provides AVIF, HEIF/HEIC, JXL and many more formats.
- Recommended build dependency: gtest so you may run `make check` to validate the build
- Ensure `ENABLE_TRANSLATIONS` is `ON` (default: `ON`)
- Nomacs only requires the opencv-core and opencv-imgproc components at runtime, not the full opencv suite. This will save substantial space when installing nomacs.

## Build nomacs (MacOS)

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) for easier installation of dependencies.
Install required dependencies:

```console
brew install qt6 exiv2 opencv libraw quazip cmake pkg-config
```

Go to the `nomacs` directory and run the correct cmake for your hardware and Qt version. We recommend Qt6.

```console
cd nomacs; mkdir build; cd build

# Qt6 / Intel 
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt6/lib/cmake cmake -D ENABLE_QUAZIP=ON ../ImageLounge

# Qt6 / Apple Silicon
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/qt6/lib/cmake cmake -D ENABLE_QUAZIP=ON ../ImageLounge
```

Run make:

```console
make
```

You will now have a binary (`nomacs.app`), which you can test (or use directly):

```console
# simulate opening from Finder
open nomacs.app

# to see logging
./nomacs.app/Contents/MacOS/nomacs
```

Homebrew seems to be missing kimageformats so we haves this option until that happens:

```console
make kimageformats
```

Nomacs registers supported file types via the Info.plist file in the app bundle. This is essential for open-with, drag-and-drop, etc features of the Finder. Supported types vary depending on what options to cmake, Qt and OS version, homebrew configuration, and even nomacs user-specified custom file types (via `Tools/Add Image Format`).

Note that nomacs does not automatically make itself the default application for any supported types at this time, you will need to you use the open-with function in "Get Info" etc.

To ensure it is correct for the current build, run

```console
make filetypes
make
```

When you are satisfied and want to install it to `/Applications`, use:

```console
sudo make install
```

If you want a self-contained bundle (`nomacs.app`) and dmg file (`nomacs.dmg`) that can't be broken by homebrew updates, use:

```console
make bundle
```

If macdeployqt complains about `ERROR: Cannot resolve rpath "@rpath/QtGui.framework/Versions/A/QtGui"` [here](https://github.com/orgs/Homebrew/discussions/2823#discussioncomment-2010340) is the solution:

```console
cd /usr/local/lib/QtGui.framework/Versions/A
install_name_tool -id '@rpath/QtGui.framework/Versions/A/QtGui' QtGui
otool -L QtGui | head -2
QtGui:
        @rpath/QtGui.framework/Versions/A/QtGui (compatibility version 6.0.0, current version 6.7.0)
```

## Build nomacs (Windows Cross-Compile)

Compiles nomacs for Windows using M Cross Environment (MXE) from a Linux/Unix host.

MXE environment is usually compiled from source, however you may be able to skip this if MXE has packages for your platform:

```bash
git clone <mxe url>
cd mxe

# qt6 (quazip-qt6 is unavailable)
make MXE_TARGETS='x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared' qt6-qtbase qt6-qtimageformats qt6-qttools qt6-qt5compat opencv tiff exiv2 libraw
```

Setup build environment:

```bash
export MXE_DIR=~/mxe
export MXE_TARGET=x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared
export PATH="${MXE_DIR}/usr/bin:$PATH"

alias pkg-config=${MXE_TARGET}-pkg-config
alias qmake=${MXE_TARGET}-qmake
alias cmake=${MXE_TARGET}-cmake
```

Run cmake out-of-tree:

```bash
mkdir build-nomacs
cd build-nomacs

cmake -D ENABLE_TRANSLATIONS=ON -D ENABLE_HEIF=ON -D ENABLE_AVIF=ON  \
-DENABLE_JXL=ON -D USE_SYSTEM_QUAZIP=OFF <nomacs-path>/ImageLounge
```

Compile nomacs:

```bash
make -j8
make collect
```

Run on WINE:

```bash
wine nomacs-mingw/nomacs.exe
```

Run on Windows:

```console
cd C:\
xcopy /DEY <shared-folder>\build-nomacs\nomacs-mingw nomacs
cd nomacs
nomacs.exe
```

## Build nomacs (Windows with MSYS2)

```bash
export target=mingw-w64-x86_64

pacman -S $target-qt5-base $target-qt5-svg $target-qt5-winextras $target-qt5-tools \
          $target-libraw $target-libtiff $target-exiv2 $target-opencv $target-cmake $target-gcc

export PATH=/ming64:$PATH

cd <build-dir>

cmake -D ENABLE_TRANSLATIONS=ON -D USE_SYSTEM_QUAZIP=ON <nomacs-dir>/ImageLounge

cmake --build . --parallel 8
```

## Enable Debug output

To enable Qt debug messages set

```bash
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ...
```

at the Makefiles generation phase.
